This tool depends on the following packages installed to build, their precise name may differ in your distro.
1. libpwquality-devel( optional dependency used to check the quality of passwords when creating volumes )
2. libblkid-devel
3. libqt4-devel( required if building GUI components )
4. gcc
5. gcc-c++
6. cryptsetup-devel
7. cmake
8. libtcplay-devel( optional dependency used to create truecrypt volumes )
9. libgcrypt-devel
10.libsecret-devel( optional dependency to store keys in gnome's libsecret )
11.kde-devel( optional dependency to store keys in kde's kwallet )
12.pkg-config
13.libdevmapper-devel aka device-mapper-devel.
14.uuid-devel

The precise names of the above packages in debian are:

8. libtcplay-dev ( optional dependency used to create TrueCrypt volumes and change TrueCrypt volume keys )
9. libgcrypt11-dev
10.libsecret-1-dev( optional dependency used to store and retrieve volume keys using gnome's libsecret )
11.not sure of the package name( optional dependency used to store and retrieve volume keys using kde's kwallet )

The project is made up of two components,the command line "pure C" based backend components and GUI Qt/C++ based front end components.

After you have above packages installed,run these 5 command to build and install.
The last command depends on your distribution,go with the one recommended by disto.

1.0 mkdir build

2.0 cd build

To build only the backends,run the following command
3.1 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DNOGUI=yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

To build the backends as well as front ends,run the following command
3.2 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

3.3
To build frontends without KDE(kwallet) support, add "-DNOKDE=true". eg cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DNOKDE=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

3.4
To build frontends without gnome(gnome-keyring) support, add "-DNOGNOME=true". eg cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DNOGNOME=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

3.5
udev is not consulted when deciding if a volume is system or not,only fstab is.To also include udev,add the following config option: "-DUDEVSUPPORT=true"
If the option is set,section 7 of the FAQ talks about removing volumes from a list of system partitions udev considers them as system and the user prefer
them not to( udev is known to identify some external hard drives as system )

3.6
Volumes by default are mounted in "/run/media/private/$USER".A compile time option of "-DHOMEMOUNTPREFIX=true" will cause volumes to be mounted
instead in user's home directory.
eg: cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DHOMEMOUNTPREFIX=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

3.7
Qt4 is the default Qt dependency,to build against Qt5,pass "-DQT5=true" to cmake

4.0 make

5.0 make install ( or sudo make install or su -c "make install" )

6.0 to uninstall the program,run make uninstall( or sudo make uninstall or su -c "make uninstall" )

After you have it installed,run "zuluCrypt-test" to make sure everything is working as expected.
