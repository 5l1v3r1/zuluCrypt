This tool depends on the following packages installed to build, their precise name may differ in your distro.
1. libmount-devel
2. libblkid-devel
3. Qt-devel( required if building GUI components )
4. gcc
5. gcc-c++
6. cryptsetup-devel
7. cmake

The package is made up of two components,the command line "pure C" based backend components and Qt/C++ based front end components.

After you have above packages installed,run these 5 command to build and install.
The last command depends on your distribution,go with the one recommended by disto.

1.0 mkdir build 

2.0 cd build

To build only the backends,run the following command
3.1 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DNOGUI=yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MINSIZEREL . ..

To build the backends as well as front ends,run the following command
3.2 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MINSIZEREL . ..

3.3 
To build frontends without KDE(kwallet) support, add "-DNOKDE=true". eg cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DNOKDE=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MINSIZEREL . ..

3.4
To build frontends without gnome(gnome-keyring) support, add "-DNOGNOME=true". eg cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DNOGNOME=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MINSIZEREL . ..

3.5
udev is not consulted when deciding if a volume is system or not,only fstab is.To also include udev,add the following config option: "-DUDEVSUPPORT=true"
If the option is set,section 7 of the FAQ talks about removing volumes from a list of system partitions udev considers them as system and the user prefer
them not to( udev is known to identify some external hard drives as system )

4.0 make

5.0 make install ( or sudo make install or su -c "make install" )

After you have it installed,run "zuluCrypt-test" to make sure everything is working as expected.
