 * The above line is made up of most if not all bash special characters.
 * 
 * The above line of text appears in a bunch of places for the following reasons.
 * 
 *1. popen uses a shell and those characters in the above line triggers bash intelligence and hence
 *   all of their occurances are preceded by a backslash to escape them. All user inputs that goes to popen
 *   are escaped to stop bash from going crazy when an inputs with interesting character combination is used.
 * 
 *2. cryptsetup seem to create two mappers when any of the characters are used in the mapper address. The bogus
 *   mapper has the character in its name and the one used by crypsetup has a '_' as a substitute for them and this confuses
 *   zuluCrypt-gui. For consistency reason, all of them are substituted by '_' before they are passed to cryptsetup
 *   so that it can create only one mapper.
