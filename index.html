<a id="zulucrypt" class="anchor" href="#zulucrypt" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>zuluCrypt</h2>

<p>zuluCrypt does hard drives encryption and it can manage plain dm-crypt volumes,LUKS encrypted volumes,TrueCrypt encrypted volumes and VeraCrypt encrypted volumes.</p>

<p>zuluCrypt can manage encrypted volumes that are hosted in image files,in lvm volumes,in mdraid volumes as well as in hard drives and usb sticks.</p>

<p>zuluCrypt can also encrypt stand alone files(zuluCrypt menu-&gt;zC-&gt;encrypt a file).</p>

<h2>
<a id="zulumount" class="anchor" href="#zulumount" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>zuluMount</h2>

<p>zuluMount is bundled with zuluCrypt and its meant to be used as a general purpose tool that mount and unmount zuluCrypt supported encrypted volumes as well as unencrypted volumes and it can be used as a substitute to udisks,pmount and related tools.</p>

<p>zuluMount-gui can also be used as a frontend to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EncFS">encfs.</a>. Just drag and drop encfs encrypted folder on zuluMount-gui to unlock it.</p>

<p>zuluMount-gui is ideal for use as a desktop environment/file manager independent tool for mounting/unmounting encrypted and unencrypted volumes.</p>

<p>Some options of zuluMount-gui are set through its tray icon,if you are on a GNOME3 desktop,you can access those options through GNOME3 extension like <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/495/topicons/">topicons.</a>    </p>

<h2>
<a id="key-sources" class="anchor" href="#key-sources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>key sources.</h2>

<p>zuluCrypt has a plugin architecture that allows it to retrieve keys to unlock volume from difference source:</p>

<ul>
<li>from gnome's keyring.</li>
<li>from kde's kwallet.</li>
<li>from internal storage system powered by libgcrypt.</li>
<li>from a keyfile where key = contents of a keyfile.</li>
<li>from a combination of a passphrase and keyfile where key = passphrase + content of keyfile.</li>
<li>from a combination of a passphrase and keyfile where key = gpg_symmetric_decrypt( passphrase,keyfile contents )</li>
<li>from a combination of a passphrase and keyfile where key = hmac-sha256( passphrase,keyfile contents )</li>
</ul>

<a id="where-did-the-name-come-from" class="anchor" href="#where-did-the-name-come-from" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>where did the name come from?</h2>

<p>The "crypt" part is there to show core feature of the tool. The "zulu" part come from "zulu time", commonly known as "GMT"( Greenwich Mean Time ). The tv was on as i was thinking of what name to use for the project and somebody on tv kept mentioning "zulu time"( i think it was a military related show ) and the zulu part of the name got stuck.</p>

<a id="various-components-of-the-tools" class="anchor" href="#various-components-of-the-tools" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>various components of the tools</h2>

<p>zuluCrypt is made up of two components: The back end,CLI interface is called "zuluCrypt-cli".it is build using C and has required dependencies on libblkid,libcryptsetup and an optional dependency on libtcplay. The front end is Qt GUI application called "zuluCrypt-gui",it is build using C++/Qt</p>

<p>zuluMount is made up of two components: The back end,CLI interface is called "zuluMount-cli".It is build using C and has a dependency on zuluCrypt-cli libraries. The front end is a Qt GUI application called "zuluMount-gui".It is build using C++/Qt</p>

<p>The GUI components are optional and the project can be build without them.They have a run-time optional dependency on <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-open">"xdg-open"</a>.If present and working properly,a default file manager will open a mount point folder automatically when a volume is opened/mounted.</p>
