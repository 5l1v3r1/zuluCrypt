{"name":"zuluCrypt","tagline":"zuluCrypt is a simple,feature rich and powerful solution for hard drives encryption.","body":"## zuluCrypt\r\n\r\nzuluCrypt does hard drives encryption and it can manage plain dm-crypt volumes,LUKS encrypted volumes,TrueCrypt encrypted volumes and VeraCrypt encrypted volumes.\r\n\r\nzuluCrypt can manage encrypted volumes that are hosted in image files,in lvm volumes,in mdraid volumes as well as in hard drives and usb sticks.\r\n\r\nzuluCrypt can also encrypt stand alone files(zuluCrypt menu->zC->encrypt a file).\r\n\r\n## zuluMount\r\n\r\nzuluMount is bundled with zuluCrypt and its meant to be used as a general purpose tool that mount and unmount zuluCrypt supported encrypted volumes as well as unencrypted volumes and it can be used as a substitute to udisks,pmount and related tools.\r\n\r\nzuluMount-gui can also be used as a frontend to <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EncFS\">encfs.</a>. Just drag and drop encfs encrypted folder on zuluMount-gui to unlock it.\r\n\r\nzuluMount-gui is ideal for use as a desktop environment/file manager independent tool for mounting/unmounting encrypted and unencrypted volumes.\r\n\r\nSome options of zuluMount-gui are set through its tray icon,if you are on a GNOME3 desktop,you can access those options through GNOME3 extension like <a href=\"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/495/topicons/\">topicons.</a>    \r\n\r\n## screen shots\r\n\r\nscreenshots are at the end of this page.\r\n\r\n## video reviews\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb39XAsnixo\">click this link to see a youtube video showing some features of zuluCrypt</a>\r\n \r\n## zuluCrypt download page\r\n\r\nlatest released version is 4.8.0 and it can be downloaded by clicking one of the three below links.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases/download/4.8.0/zuluCrypt-4.8.0.tar.bz2\">zuluCrypt-4.8.0.tar.bz2</a> \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases/download/4.8.0/zuluCrypt-4.8.0.tar.xz\">zuluCrypt-4.8.0.tar.xz</a> \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases/download/4.8.0/zuluCrypt-4.8.0.tar.xz.asc\">zuluCrypt-4.8.0.tar.xz.asc</a> \r\n\r\n## binary packages\r\n\r\nFedora and opensuse users can install binary packages by following instructions on <a href=\"http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Amhogomchungu&package=zuluCrypt\">this</a> link\r\n\r\nBinary packages for debian and ubuntu are below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases/download/4.8.0/zuluCrypt-4.8.0-debian-7-Wheezy.tar.xz\">zuluCrypt-4.8.0-debian-7-Wheezy.tar.xz</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases/download/4.8.0/zuluCrypt-4.8.0-debian-8-Jessie.tar.xz\">zuluCrypt-4.8.0-debian-8-Jessie.tar.xz</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases/download/4.8.0/zuluCrypt-4.8.0-ubuntu-14.04-Trusty_Tahr.tar.xz\">zuluCrypt-4.8.0-ubuntu-14.04-Trusty_Tahr.tar.xz</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases/download/4.8.0/zuluCrypt-4.8.0-ubuntu-14.10-Utopic_Unicorn.tar.xz\">zuluCrypt-4.8.0-ubuntu-14.10-Utopic_Unicorn.tar.xz</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases/download/4.8.0/zuluCrypt-4.8.0-ubuntu-15.04-Vivid_Vervet.tar.xz\">zuluCrypt-4.8.0-ubuntu-15.04-Vivid_Vervet.tar.xz</a>\r\n\r\nThese archives contains binaries for both 32 bit and 64 bit systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlder versions can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/releases\">here.</a>\r\n\r\n## cryptsetup\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/blob/master/README.md\">cryptsetup</a> is one of the most popular linux native solutions for block device encryption.\r\n \r\n## tcplay\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bwalex/tc-play\">tcplay</a> is an independent,BSD licensed full implementation of truecrypt formatted encrypted volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## VeraCrypt\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/\">VeraCrypt</a> is a security enhanced fork of TrueCrypt. \r\n\r\n## key sources.\r\n\r\nzuluCrypt has a plugin architecture that allows it to retrieve keys to unlock volume from difference source:\r\n* gnome's keyring.\r\n* kde's kwallet.\r\n* an internal storage system powered by libgcrypt.\r\n* a keyfile where key = contents of a keyfile.\r\n* a combination of a passphrase and keyfile where key = passphrase + content of keyfile.\r\n* a combination of a passphrase and keyfile where key = gpg_symmetric_decrypt( passphrase,keyfile )\r\n* a combination of a passphrase and keyfile where key = hmac-sha256( passphrase,keyfile )\r\n\r\n## where did the name come from?\r\n\r\nThe \"crypt\" part is there to show core feature of the tool. The \"zulu\" part come from \"zulu time\", commonly known as \"GMT\"( Greenwich Mean Time ). The tv was on as i was thinking of what name to use for the project and somebody on tv kept mentioning \"zulu time\"( i think it was a military related show ) and the zulu part of the name got stuck.\r\n\r\n##various components of the tools\r\n\r\nzuluCrypt is made up of two components: The back end,CLI interface is called \"zuluCrypt-cli\".it is build using C and has required dependencies on libblkid,libcryptsetup and an optional dependency on libtcplay. The front end is Qt GUI application called \"zuluCrypt-gui\",it is build using C++/Qt\r\n\r\nzuluMount is made up of two components: The back end,CLI interface is called \"zuluMount-cli\".It is build using C and has a dependency on zuluCrypt-cli libraries. The front end is a Qt GUI application called \"zuluMount-gui\".It is build using C++/Qt\r\n\r\nThe GUI components are optional and the project can be build without them.They have a run-time optional dependency on <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-open\">\"xdg-open\"</a>.If present and working properly,a default file manager will open a mount point folder automatically when a volume is opened/mounted.\r\n\r\n## frequently asked questions\r\nThe list of most frequently asked questions can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n## zuluCrypt screenshots\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=10shr8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i59.tinypic.com/10shr8k.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2ef03f4\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i57.tinypic.com/2ef03f4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a>\r\n\r\n## zuluMount screenshot\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2nss0he\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i62.tinypic.com/2nss0he.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"></a>\r\n\r\nlast update: Wed Dec  2 11:02:39 EAT 2015","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
