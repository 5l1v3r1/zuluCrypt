zuluCrypt is a front end to cryptsetup. It makes it easy to use 
cryptsetup to manage encrypted volumes by providing a Qt based 
GUI and a simpler to use cli front end to cryptsetup.

It does the same thing truecrypt does but uses(through cryptsetup) cryptographic 
infrastructure that exist inside the kernel in linux and some bsd systems.
