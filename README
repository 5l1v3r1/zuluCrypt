build against: cryptsetup version 1.3.0
Qt version:    4.7.4

zuluCrypt is a front end to cryptsetup. It aims to simplify using cryptsetup volumes by creating a simple to use
command line interface and a Qt based GUI front end to the command line.

The command line program is called "zuluCrypt-cli", the Qt based GUI is called "zuluCrypt".
The cli part of the program is an suid program to allow management of the volumes without 
setting up sudo with appropriate permissions first or requiring root's password.

The GUI part of the program calls the cli part for its operations.

How to build:
Run the "build" script.
If you are already in the directory with the source code, just type "./build" to build it.

How to install:
Run "./build install" when in the source code folder after you have run "./build"

How to use the GUI part of the program.
It GUI should be obvious enough to figure it out without instructions. 

How to use the cli part of the suite.

1. How to open a volumes.

zuluCrypt-cli open <path to volume> <mount point path> <mode>

<path to volume>      is a path to an encrypted file or partition.
<path to mount point> is a path to a folder zuluCrypt will create a mount point to the volume in.
<mode>                is opening mode, two options are allowed "ro" for read only and "rw" for read and write.

The above usage is appropriate when using the program interactively because the user will be asked for a password and it wont be displayed.


Another way to open a volume is with this format. This format is more convenient when the cli is used by another application.

zuluCrypt-cli <path to volume> <mount point path> <mode> <passphrase> 

2. How to check the status of an opened volume

zuluCrypt-cli status <path to volume>

The last part of the address should be suffient.
ie. if a volume is at "/dev/sda4", zuluCrypt-cli status sda4 will work, so will zuluCrypt-cli status /dev/sda4

3. How to close an opened volume
zuluCrypt-cli close <path to volume>
The last part of the address should be suffient/
ie. If a volume is at "/dev/sda4", zuluCrypt-cli close sda4 will work, so will zuluCrypt-cli close /dev/sda4

4. How to create new volumes
zuluCrypt-cli create <path to volume> <file system type> <encryption type>

<encryption type> is either "plain" or "luks"

example usage
zuluCrypt-cli create /home/mhogomchungu/BankDocuments ext4 plain
zuluCrypt-cli create /mnt/mhogomchungu/ConfidentialBusinessRecords ext4 luks

Note:
Creation of volumes on hard drives(addresses starting with "/dev") is currently disabled. Hence this tool can currently
only create new volumes in files.

This tool is an suid program and allowing it to work on hard drives located in "/dev/" could allow a normal user to effectively destroy
root partition if they wish to.
