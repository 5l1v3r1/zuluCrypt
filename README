zuluCrypt is a front end to cryptsetup. It aims to simplify using cryptsetup volumes by creating a simple to use
command line interface and a Qt based GUI front end to the command line.

The command line program is called "zuluCrypt-cli", the Qt based GUI is called "zuluCrypt".
The cli part of the program is an suid program to allow management of the volumes without 
setting up sudo with appropriate permissions first or requiring root's password.

The GUI part of the program calls the cli part for its operations.

How to build:
Run the "build" script.
If you are already in the directory with the source code, just type "./build" to build it.

How to install:
Run "./build install" when in the source code folder after you have run "./build"
The "zuluCrypt" program should appear on your menu list, if not log out and back in.

How to uninstall:
Run "./build uninstall" when in the source code folder.

How to use the GUI part of the program.
It GUI should be obvious enough to figure it out without instructions. 

How to use the cli part of the suite.

1. How to open a volumes.

zuluCrypt-cli open <path to volume> <mount point path> <mode>

<path to volume>      is a path to an encrypted file or partition.
<path to mount point> is a path to a folder zuluCrypt will create a mount point to the volume in.
<mode>                is opening mode, two options are allowed "ro" for read only and "rw" for read and write.

The above usage is appropriate when using the program interactively because the user will be asked for a password and it wont be displayed.


Another way to open a volume is with this format. This format is more convenient when the cli is used by another application.

zuluCrypt-cli <path to volume> <mount point path> <mode> <pass type > <passphrase> 

<pass type> is either "-f" or "-p". Option "-f" expects a keyfile while "-p" expects a "naked" passphrase

2. How to check the status of an opened volume

zuluCrypt-cli status <path to volume>

The last part of the address should be suffient.
ie. if a volume is at "/dev/sda4", zuluCrypt-cli status sda4 will work, so will zuluCrypt-cli status /dev/sda4

3. How to close an opened volume
zuluCrypt-cli close <path to volume>

4. How to create new volumes
zuluCrypt-cli create <path to volume> <file system type> <encryption type>

<encryption type> is either "plain" or "luks"

example usage
zuluCrypt-cli create /home/mhogomchungu/BankDocuments ext4 plain
zuluCrypt-cli create /mnt/mhogomchungu/ConfidentialBusinessRecords ext4 luks

another alternative suitable when called from another program:

zuluCrypt-cli create /mnt/mhogomchungu/ConfidentialBusinessRecords ext4 luks -f path-to-keyfile

zuluCrypt-cli create /mnt/mhogomchungu/ConfidentialBusinessRecords ext4 luks -p typing-in-passphrase

Note:
Only non system partitions can be created. Non system partitions are partitions that do not have active entries in fstab.

5. How to add a key to a luks volume
zuluCrypt-cli addkey <path to luks volume> < source > < passphrase > < source > < passphrase1 >
source could be either "-f" or "-p" for keyfile and naked passphrase respectively
passphrase must be a key already in the volume

for interactive use, run zuluCrypt-cli addkey < path to volume > and follow instructions

6. How to delete a keyfile
zuluCrypt-cli removekey <path to volume> < source > < passphrase >
passphrase must be already in the volume
source could be "-f" or "-p" for a keyfile or naked passphrase respectively.

for interactive use, run zuluCrypt-cli removekey < path to volume > and follow instructions
	
7. How to see which ones and how many slots are empty is a luks volume
zuluCrypt-cli emptyslots <path to volume>
"1" represent an accupied slots
"0" represent an empty slots

8.
How to get a list of all partitions
zuluCrypt-cli partitions 1

How to get a list of system partitions
zuluCrypt-cli partitions 2

How to get a list of non system partitions
zuluCrypt-cli partitions 3

This tool will create volumes only in non system partitions. This will allow a normal user to create volumes
in external hard drives but not on a root's partition effectively distroying a system.

System partition is a partition with an active entry in /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab
