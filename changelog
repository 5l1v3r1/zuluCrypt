version 1.0.1
fix bug:
- On interactive mode, checking if the two passphrases are the same fails something when stdin buffer isnt emptied before reading the first password.

","(comma) is not a valid mount point path. the cli prevents this but the GUI just fails without informing a user why. Added a dialog to inform a user
when they select comma as a mount point.

comma as a mount point is disallowed because it sits right next to "dot" button and most people(ie. me) usually press "."(dot) key to mean "present working directory" 
but will miss the key and press comma key and start wondering why things arent they way they are supposed to be.
The comma key should have been on the other side of the keyboard!!!

version 2.0
add support for adding and deleting keys in luks based volumes in the cli and gui.

version 3.0
add support for creating both plain and luks based volumes in both files and partitions.
