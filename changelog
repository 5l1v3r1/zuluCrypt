version 1.0.1
fix bug:
- On interactive mode, checking if the two passphrases are the same fails something when stdin buffer isnt emptied before reading the first password.

","(comma) is not a valid mount point path. the cli prevents this but the GUI just fails without informing a user why. Added a dialog to inform a user
when they select comma as a mount point.

comma as a mount point is disallowed because it sits right next to "dot" button and most people(ie. me) usually press "."(dot) key to mean "present working directory" 
but will miss the key and press comma key and start wondering why things arent they way they are supposed to be.
The comma key should have been on the other side of the keyboard!!!

version 4.3.2
-- ext3/ext4 can not be mounted with user specified permissions and they use the permissions set when the volume was last mounted.
    This creates a problem on freshly created volumes because they always end up owned by root. This update fix the problem by setting
    permissions everytime a volume is opened in read/write mode. If a volume open with root as owner, then reopen the volume in read/write
    mode and permissions will be set properly(0700 with the owner being the user who opened the volume)
  
    
version 4.3.3
-- keyfile with '\0' character in them were not properly handled and volumes failed to open using them.
